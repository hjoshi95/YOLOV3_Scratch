# YOLOV3_Scratch
An implementation of YOLO V3 functionality from scratch accustomed for PASCAL Voc and COCO dataset.

Credits go to Alladin Perrson for amazing videos and tutorials

I've mostly added comments and a few minor changes so that one could understand line by line as to what's happening. The idea is to understand how YOLO works,
the anchor box predictions and the concept behind IoU to discard non qualifying thresholds.
